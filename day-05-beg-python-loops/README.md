# PyPassword Generator

A Python program that generates secure random passwords based on user specifications.

## Description

This PyPassword Generator is a command-line tool created as part of the "100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp". The program demonstrates several Python programming concepts including:

- Using the `random` module for secure randomization
- Working with lists and strings
- For loops and iteration
- String manipulation and joining
- User input handling and type conversion

The generator allows users to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password, then creates a strong password with those elements randomly arranged.

## Features

- Customizable password length and complexity
- Random character selection from letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols
- Character shuffling to prevent predictable patterns
- Simple command-line interface

## How to Use

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Download the `main.py` file.
3. Run the program from your terminal/command prompt:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to specify:
   - How many letters you want
   - How many symbols you want
   - How many numbers you want
5. The program will generate and display your password

## Example Usage

```
Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!
How many letters would you like in your password?
8
How many symbols would you like?
2
How many numbers would you like?
2

Your password is: KwjrM8l$5!H
```

## Password Strength

Passwords generated by this tool have several security advantages:

- Randomized order of characters
- Mix of character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- Customizable length
- No dictionary words or patterns

For maximum security, it's recommended to include at least:
- 8 or more total characters
- A mix of all available character types

## Implementation Details

The generator uses two different approaches to create passwords:

1. **List Approach (Primary)**: Builds a list of characters, shuffles them, then joins them into a string
2. **String Approach (Alternative)**: Builds a string, converts to list for shuffling, then back to string

The list approach is more efficient as it avoids conversion steps, since lists in Python are mutable while strings are immutable.

## Security Note

While this generator creates strong random passwords, users should still follow good password security practices:
- Use different passwords for different accounts
- Consider using a password manager to store complex passwords
- Ensure passwords are not shared or written down in unsecured locations
